Project Highlights:
In this project, I integrated cutting-edge technologies to create a robust, responsive, and user-friendly platform. Spring Boot empowered the backend, ensuring a scalable and efficient server-side operation. With React.js, I designed an engaging frontend, allowing seamless user interactions. Utilizing Java, I implemented complex algorithms, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript enabled intuitive and visually appealing interfaces. The implementation of REST API facilitated smooth communication between various components, and Spring MVC ensured a well-organized and structured application. Additionally, Spring Authorization was employed to enhance security and user authentication.
